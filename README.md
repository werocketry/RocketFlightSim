# RocketFlightSim

RocketFlightSim (RFS) is a lightweight 3-DOF rocket flight simulator. Simulation capabilities include:
- Simulation of single and multi-stage rockets from ignition to landing
- A comprehensive environment model for tropospheric flight
- The option to add simple airbrakes to a rocket to induce drag

RFS is designed to be simple to use, understand, and modify, with the goal of providing a platform for students and hobbyists to learn about rocket flight dynamics and simulation. Emphasis is placed on computational efficiency, with the goal of being lightweight enough to run real-time during flight on an onboard microcontroller.

Note that RFS runs fastest on Python 3.13 due to its JIT compilation capabilities.
