# RocketFlightSim

RocketFlightSim (RFS) is a lightweight flight simulator for experimental rockets. It currently supports simulation of both single and multi-stage rockets in the troposphere, from ignition to apogee. Simple airbrakes can be added to a rocket to induce drag.

RFS is designed to be simple to use, understand, and modify, with the goal of providing a platform for students and hobbyists to learn about rocket flight dynamics and simulation. Emphasis is placed on computational efficiency, with the goal of being lightweight enough to run real-time during flight on an onboard microcontroller.
