### `/rocketflightsim/tools/`
Contains tools that perform various tasks that use the main library. 

TODO: add a way to import .eng files to define a motor object
TODO: after ^, add a script that uses the thrustcurve.org API for motor selection
TODO: as more additions keep happening, maybe make it easy to select which aspects affecting a flight are simulated, automating the process of selecting which considerations to take into account to create a modified simulator when running it many times quickly is extra important
TODO: add converter for ork/RocketPy?
